# Tesla: Boots wit da furr website (udacity_p1)
udacity project 1
Hi! It's my first web dev project, a static html/css webpage, so it's a bit of a mess- I'm sorry.

There are three directories, one for pictures used in the project or considered for use at least, one for stylesheets (css), 
and one for content pages (html)

The page is responsive & resizeable down to 561px.

Dedicated to my homedawg, tesla (literally a dog in my home) <3
