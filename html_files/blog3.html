                        Today was our first christmas photoshoot. I got her these accessories last year-
                        our first christmas together, but I forgot to pack them so i left it at my apartment.
                        oooooops.. so it was one thing trying to get her to keep her hat on, but we also
                        couldn't get her to focus.
    
                        hence we discovered her fondness for coasters.. we just had some lying around so we
                        tried getting her attention with them and it worked unbelievably well. she got tired
                        so we ended up getting some pretty good derp photos too.. anyway look at this adorable
                        lil one &hearts;

                    I didn't get Tesla on Christmas, but she's actually the best gift in my life.
                    She's a problem child but also my lifesaver haha &hearts; &hearts;
