                <p>
                        Today was our first christmas photoshoot. I got her these accessories last year-
                        our first christmas together, but I forgot to pack them so i left it at my apartment.
                        oooooops.. So it was one thing trying to get her to keep her hat on, but we also
                        couldn't get her to focus.
    
                        Hence we discovered her fondness for coasters.. we just had some lying around so we
                        tried getting her attention with them and it worked unbelievably well. she got tired
                        so we ended up getting some pretty good derp photos too.. anyway look at this adorable
                        lil one &hearts;

                    I didn't get Tesla on Christmas, but she's actually the best gift in my life.
                    She's a problem child but also my lifesaver haha &hearts; &hearts;
                    In honor of this dumbbutt, a quote:
                    <blockquote cite="https://thebark.com/content/dogs-life">
                            People seem able to love their dogs with an unabashed acceptance that 
                            they rarely demonstrate with family or friends. The dogs do not disappoint 
                            them, or if they do, the owners manage to forget about it quickly. I want 
                            to learn to love like this, the way we love our dogs, with pride and 
                            enthusiasm and a complete amnesia for faults. In short, to love others the 
                            way our dogs love us. When a dog devotes so much of herself to your 
                            happiness, it only stands to reason you would want to make that dog 
                            happy in return. Things that would seem unreasonably extravagant for 
                            yourself are nothing less than a necessity for your dog.
