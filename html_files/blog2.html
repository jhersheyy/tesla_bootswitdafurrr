                <p>
                    Of course such a fluffy dog needs a lot of water, but if im gonna leave her
                    home alone and/or take her out soon I dont let her drink all the water she wants.
                    BUT shes kind of a brat so sometimes she'll passive aggressively make a point by
                    dramatically licking her empty bowl... she doesn't realize its for her own good T_T

                    Those are mushed up carrots by the way.. since she's a picky eater, i have to add
                    fun things (like carrots but her favorites are yogurt, rice, and eggs) so thats why there
                    are little orange things everywhere. im glad she ate all of her food but why did she
                    also have to make a mess.. i picked it up PIECE. BY. PIECE. its fine at least she cute
                </p>

                <p>it's so funny when she does this; it's like she's saying LOOK AT ALL
                    THIS WATER I DONT HAVE (:  I probably have like 2 more series of pictures like this
                </p>
                <h4>Exhibit C</h4>
                <p>This time is the opposite case, where she had water and she spilled it while I was
                    at practice.. did she want attention or is was she just being dumb? either way look
                    at this quality pout
