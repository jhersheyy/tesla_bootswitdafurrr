                    <p> Hi welcome! This is my website to show people how to take care of my 
                        doggo and other various things about her. This is what she looks like
                        most of the time =) Her name is Tesla and she is the perfect amount of
                        idiot and adorable uwu. However, she is also a lil poop....... She is 
                        extremely food motivated so people think she's smart (but she really just
                        wants you to give her food)
                    </p>
                    <p> Tesla is a Keeshond- that's a Spitz kind of doggo. Spitz means they look
                        kinda wolfy and have pointy ears and a curly tail. They can be fluffy or 
                        not. Other spitz dogs include Shibas, Samoyeds, Pomeranians, Japanese Spitz
                        dogs, and American Eskimo Dogs. I wanted a Keeshond because they're good with
                        large families (like my extended family and also my dance family) and they're
                        smart but not too bratty/ too much of a intellectual butt. also they're hella
                        cute......  
                    </p>
                    <p> Tesla used to be a show dog in Texas, but her first owner returned her to her
                        breeder. Her parents were champions (i dont actually know what that means but
                        it's a big deal). Unfortunately her teeth grew in weird so her bottom teeth 
                        were crooked and she has kind of an underbite. I was looking for a dog at 
                        this time and got lucky with timing. I got Tesla from her breeder just within 
                        the week she got back to California, so <span class="prettytext2">CLEARLY WE WERE 
                        MEANT TO BEEeeEEEE &hearts;</span>
