                    <h2>Feeding & Water</h2>
                    <h3>Water</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Water should always be available EXCEPT at night. Since she’s not housetrained
                        (still has accidents inside), I usually keep her and her water bowl in the same 
                        room as me to keep an eye on her. <span class="g_underline">WHAT GOES IN MUST COME 
                        OUT.</span> If Tesla drinks a lot of water really fast, she will have to pee soon after. 
                        Pay attention so you can give her potty breaks as necessary ☺
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not let Tesla have any water (or food) within 1 hour of bedtime.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><em>*Rule of thumb: A dog should drink 1-1.5 oz of water per pound they are; 
                            Tesla is about 30 lbs, so she should have about 30-45 oz of water per day.
                        </em></p>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        Remember, Tesla must eat AFTER the hoomans eat, so she knows she’s not the boss. 
                        Moreover, while the hoomans are eating, she should be restrained aka tied up. 
                        <br>
                        How to feed her: Measure out her food and put water in the bowl AND MAKE HER SIT FOR IT. 
                        Then, play the elevator game. (See bottom of this section!) She has 10 minutes from the 
                        time you say “okay” to finish, but it should really only take her a few minutes to eat. 
                        If she doesn’t finish after 10 minutes, take away her food bowl only. If she finishes, 
                        give her dessert. Either way wait ~20 minutes for her to finish.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Morning: 3/4 cup (yellow measuring cup)</li>
                            <li>Lunch: NO</li>
                            <li>Dinner: 2/3 cup (orange measuring cup)</li>
                            <li>Dessert: if she finishes all her food, I give her a treat to motivate her 
                                to finish her food every time. PLUS, if she finishes all her dinner, 
                                I give her a toothbrush treat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>
                        Tip: If she doesn’t eat after the first couple minutes, kick/ put a bit of her kibble 
                        on the floor. Sometimes, she just doesn’t like her food bowl…
                        If she doesn’t finish her dinner, give her the toothbrush after you an hour or so.
                        She needs it so her breath isn’t smelly.

                    <h4>The Elevator Game</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you feed her meals, she should wait until you put the bowls down AND say “okay.” 
                        Before you lower the bowls, she should be sitting. If she pokes her head in or starts to 
                        get up for the food before the bowls are on the floor or before you’ve said “okay,” then 
                        pick it up and raise it out of her reach. Make her sit again, and then slowly lower the bowls 
                        again to the floor, raising it again if she doesn’t wait properly. I typically wait a second 
                        or something after I put the bowls down to say okay. You can do this exercise with treats and 
                        toys too!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bathroom Time</h2>
                    <p>
                    If you take her out to pee/poop, but she doesn’t, then just be more cautious of her 
                    habits after you come back inside. If she starts circling the floor or whining or 
                    looking at you unusually intently that usually means she needs to go outside. 
                    I also think if she sniffs the bottom of the sliding door, it’s like she’s looking 
                    for a way to go outside. 
                    <br>
                    It’s important to differentiate play time and potty time. If she doesn’t go potty 
                    after a while after exhibiting I-wanna-go-outside behaviors, then bring her in, 
                    so she had her chance but doesn’t get her way (in terms of having extra 
                    outside-playtime).
                    </p>
                    <h3>A. During downtime</h3>
                    <p>
                    Take her out as necessary, based on how much water you’ve given her/seen her drink.
                    </p>
                    <h3>B. After meals</h3>
                    <p>
                    After her meal, wait 20-30 minutes and then take her out to go potty.  
                    She should pee AND poop after her meals, but if she doesn’t poop after her dinner, 
                    it’s okay- she can still poop before bedtime.
                    Tip: Running around a bit helps her poop ☺
                    </p>
                    <h3>C. Before bedtime</h3>
                    <p>
                    Take her out before you go to sleep and then give her a nice wipe-down 
                    (fur, paws, peepee and poopoo/booty) 
                    <br>
                    See cleaning section for if she has an accident in the house/car/whatever.

                                a whole. Just make sure they’re small enough to 
                                come out, but there’s a bigger piece in there that 
                                makes everything a little harder. Also be sure to 
                                switch out the treats in there every couple days, 
                                so she’s not eating old, stale treats.

                                bring toys out, the hard rubbery ones are preferable, 
                                so the plush ones don’t get dirty.

                    <h2>Ditching Doggo</h2>
                    <p><strong>DO NOT LEAVE HER UNSUPERVISED IN HER PRONG (metal) COLLAR!!!! </strong>
                        Use the blue one- it still tightens if she pulls on her leash, but it leaves some space, 
                        and can’t get caught on anything like her other collar can.
                        <br><br>
                        Always keep the red kong toy prepared, in case you need to go somewhere. 
                        If you leave her in her crate, also be sure to leave a couple toys and at 
                        least 1 thing for her to chew on (a bone/chew treat). Also leave her red kong 
                        toy (more on that later.) If you’re not going to leave her in her crate, 
                        find somewhere open and weigh her down with something you can clean if 
                        she pees on it. She’s somewhat of an escape artist, so something heavy like a 
                        table is good, but she might make a big mess ☹ Also shes so strong wth

                    <h3>Preparing the Kong</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fill the toy with kibble</li>
                        <li>Run water through the kibble, shake the toy, and really make sure all 
                            the kibble is really soaked</li>
                        <li>Push the kibble down, so it becomes compressed and kind of mushy</li>
                        <li>Fill the toy to the top with the Kong filling (kong filler that looks 
                            like that ez cheese thing- picture below)</li>
                        <li>Stick a treat in the filling on top</li>
                        <li>If possible, freeze it so its more of a challenge/takes longer for her to eat</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The toy should distract her for a bit- it usually lets you leave her alone without 
                        her barking or whining ☺ but she finishes it in like 5 minutes so leave fast lol

                    <p>Make sure she hasn’t had water in the last hour. Take her out to pee/poop one last time. 
                        Use 1-2/as many as necessary wipes to clean her fur and paws and peepee and pooopoo.

                        Tell Tesla to go to bed (in her crate) and once she’s in, take off her collar. Then
                        just lock her up with a plush or rope toy for the night. If she whines right away,
                        tell her "quiet." If she whines in the middle of the night, she might need to go outside.
