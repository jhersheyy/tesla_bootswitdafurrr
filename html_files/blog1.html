                    Today was my sister's engagement party, so we blew up a
                    bunch of balloons. We thought Tesla would be scared but she
                    wasn't.. She head tilted when we were blowing them up though
                    because the machine was really loud. It was hella cute &hearts;
                    Since she seemed chill with everything, we had her go into the
                    room full of balloons and had a small photoshoot. It was cute when
                    she would boop the balloons with her nose tooooo
                </p>
                    <div class="imgcontainer">

                    from people like <q>look at me im so good and i just happen to really like pork</q>
