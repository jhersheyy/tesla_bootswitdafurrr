                    Today was my sister's engagement party, so we blew up a
                    bunch of balloons. We thought Tesla would be scared but she
                    wasn't.. She head tilted when we were blowing them up though
                    because the machine was really loud. It was hella cute &hearts;
                    Since she seemed chill with everything, we had her go into the
                    room full of balloons and had a small photoshoot. It was cute when
                    she would boop the balloons with her nose tooooo
                </p>
                    <div class="imgcontainer">

                    Aside from this cute photoshoot tesla also got spoiled with hooman food.
                    we had roasted pig and a bunch of other stuff and she kept sitting across
                    from people like "look at me im so good and i just happen to really like pork"
                    who can resist right... oh tesla you are so lucky you are cute.. she also got
                    a hold of some garlic bread by jumping up to the table smh... i got really worried
                    but she didnt get sick or anything.. she just got sick of her kibble heheh who wouldnt
